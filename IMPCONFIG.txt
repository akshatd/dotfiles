#do this pls to install oh my zsh

if using antagon-whatever theme in zsh, install the fonts from powerline
set the lang to en-utf8!
use solaris as the colour sceme in 
also install zsh-autosuggestions for fish like autosuggest
in the config file of suggest, change the highlight colour to red so can see it
make sure to compile by running make in the outer folder of the custom plugin in the oh my zsh
restart zsh to see effect
if wanna add alias, make sure to put a line like source <location of plugin zsh file>
youll need to do this for git

#setup vim
#make sure you copy over the config from the github page
do a plugininstall! also, before vundle end dont do any stupid shit like setting colour theme and all
use solarise theme with dark background!!!
make sure the terminal also has solarise selected (use that as base then select colours later)
do the powerline install from the powerline installation manual page
use vimawesome to install shit, its awesome

# fucking powerline
install normally using the pip install --user shit
then go to the rc file of zsh or whatever shell you have
then modify the PATH to contain /home/predator/.local/bin
cos it is here that the powerline executable is kept

#spotify being annoying and obscuring errything
go /home/predator/.config/spotify
modify window position, set to flase
